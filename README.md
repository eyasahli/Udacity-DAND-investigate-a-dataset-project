# Udacity-DAND-investigate-a-dataset-project

# Project Overview :
In this project, I analyzed the tmdb movie dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas , Matplotlib and seaborn.

Why this Project?

In this project, i went through the data analysis process and saw how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.


at the end of this project i was able tp :

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format i can use.
- Have experience communicating the results of my analysis.
- use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access me data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings.

this repository contains :

- the jupyter notebook of the project .
- the html version of the notebook .
- the original dataset i started with . ( tmdb movie dataset ) .
